# Dash Unit Denomination - Problem & Solution

### Introduction

*Note: In this document, "`DASH`" (in all caps) refers specifically to the unit of account, presently `100,000,000 DUFF`, whereas "Dash" can refer to the software project, the community, or the overall ecosystem.*

What is Dash's target market?  Who are Dash's competitors?

Give those questions some serious thought before reading on.  How would you answer them?  What is your ultimate goal and vision for Dash?  The answers to these questions form the premise of the discussion and arguments below.

If you consider Dash's target market to be limited to **payment processing**, with competitors such as Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Venmo, and Stripe, then you may find this document to be an uninteresting or even dangerous proposition.  If, on the other hand, you consider Dash (as I do) to be a free-market **money**, an electronic **currency**, a digital **cash**, with competition including the `YEN`, `EURO`, and `USD`, then this document is for you.  After reading it, I hope you will feel a sense of urgency to bring this issue into wider discussion in the Dash community.

##### Motivation

Dash is at a crossroads.  Two distinct paths lie ahead.  On the one hand Dash becomes a glorified payment processor.  On the other hand it becomes an independent money (that also happens to have its own built-in payment processor).  The difference is whether we intend to rely on national (fiat) currencies into the future, or, aim higher and plan ahead for Dash to fulfill *all* of the three widely-accepted functions of money:

1. Store of value
1. Medium of exchange
1. Unit of account

**Bitcoin** got stuck at **store of value**, leaving medium of exchange to separate, off-chain solutions.  **Dash** aimed higher and is committed to being a good **medium of exchange** (in addition to store of value), keeping fees low and scaling on chain.  Will Dash aim even higher and lay the necessary groundwork to become a prominent **unit of account**, culminating in goods and services being priced in `DASH`?  The answer to that will dictate which path we take at this crossroads.

Wait, are we already at that crossroads now; isn't that still a long ways down the road?  It is true that goods and services won't be priced in `DASH` any time soon, but **the decision to facilitate that is now**.  In fact, it was probably long ago, but I believe it's still not too late to change course (even though it will probably require some heavy bush whacking) to get on the path to making Dash a viable currency.

So far I haven't justified any of my claims.  In fact, I haven't really even described the problem yet.  I've just given my motivation, so that it's clear why I'm bringing this up at all.  I want Dash to be a currency, not just another PayPal or Venmo that gives deference to the USD and other national currencies.  I will expound on that in later sections.

##### Summary

With the motivation understood, I will summarize the issue at hand: **Dash's widely used unit of account, the `DASH`, is not conducive to an independently functioning currency.**  This problem won't fix itself, but it can be fixed with targeted actions, taken now.  **The only viable solution I see is to re-denominate (re-define) the `DASH`**.

There are circumstances when problems arise, and solutions present themselves and gain adoption *organically*, without anyone taking a prominent lead - people gradually adopting gold and silver for monetary use, for example.  Other solutions must be *proactively engineered*, such as building a space ship to get to the moon.  Engineering Dash is an example of the latter; making units suitable for commerce is a key task that requires proactive planning and engineering to implement.

##### Background

This topic is not new in cryptocurrency.  The Bitcoin community has had these discussions before.  It has been, and continues to be, a lengthy debate, and to this point no good solution has emerged.  Bitcoin didn't see and plan for the problem ahead of time, and it wasn't unable to organize and decide on a solution when various proposals were put forth.  Ethereum too has been plagued by this problem, although the issue is not as stark there since the their community doesn't seem to be targeting the money use case - their smart contracts interface mostly from computer to computer, so they don't need a unit that normal people are expected to use in daily conversation.

It may be too late for Bitcoin to fix their unit problem.  Ethereum doesn't really need a fix.  Dash on the other hand, *must* come up with a unit that normal people will feel comfortable with, because Dash is supposed to be digital cash.  Fortunately, Dash has been successful with re-brands and major innovations; mid-flight adaptation is the norm for Dash.  Fixing this issue is definitely possible with the right planning.

### The Problem

##### Currency Viability

For any currency to be vaible long term, it must be capable of operating smoothly and comfortably on its own, **independent** from other currencies.  Although Dash is functioning well as a store of value and medium of exchange, it is not a good unit of account.  This is due partly to volatility against national currencies, and because it is new and adoption is still low.  But even at this early stage, **`1 DASH` represents too much value** (measured in other currencies, but also in terms of goods and services).  This problem would remain even if its exchange rate were stable.

##### Buying, Spending, & Giving Dash

The problem is apparent in everyday, small purchases, such as the proverbial cup of coffee.  Already it costs a very small fraction of a unit to purchase a cup of coffee, something like `0.00417 DASH`.  With increased consumer adoption, this problem will get much, much worse, to the point where almost anything someone buys will cost a fraction of one unit of account.  **People are not accustomed to thinking in fractional values**.

The problem gets compounded when we consider not just the **spend** side of the equation, but the **buy** side also.  Someone new to cryptocurrency wants to get into Dash, so they decide to exchange some of their normal money for it.  They are immediately hit with sticker shock.  "To buy `1 DASH` I have to cough up a whole paycheck?  Hmm, oh wait, I can get 300 of this other coin for `50 USD`, that seems better."

What about when a crypto veteran wants to help friends or family members get into Dash by offering to **give** them some?  You don't want to give too much because these people are new and may lose it.  Plus, you want to give Dash to a bunch of people, so it can't be too much.  You start off by throwing them a few bucks worth.  They look at their wallet and see `.0026087 DASH`.  An underwhelming gesture - they forget about it, or worse, are put off by it.

##### Maintaining Competitive Advantage

Despite Dash being a technologically superior currency in almost every way, Dash is struggling to maintain (let alone gain) market share against the competition.  Incumbents above Dash have largely retained their positions, and emerging competition has been overtaking Dash.  Why?  I submit three observations for consideration:

1. Some coins are still riding on name recognition
1. Some coins are playing nice with the traditional monetary and financial incumbents
1. Some coins have very attractive units of account

I'm not worried about the first category (including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin) over the long term.  These coins are largely floating by on yesterdays achievements, name recognition, and early mover advantage, but they will lose market share over time.  The coins in the second category (including Ripple and Stellar) will continue to receive investment from deep-pocketed incumbent financial players.  Nothing we can do about that short of selling out and trying to *aid* rather than *compete with* fiat currencies (which I hope nobody is considering).

It's the third category that has me wondering.  What does NEM, Cardano, and IOTA offer that can justify a valuation higher than Dash?  What pushed others above Dash in the past, if even for a short time (e.g. EOS, NEO)?  **One can't help but notice that the tokens overtaking Dash are generally priced 2 to 4 orders of magnitude lower than `DASH`**.  What is the market trying to tell us?

##### Key Takeaways

All three sections above are pointing in the same direction:  **we would do well to re-engineer our coin to have a low nominal value**.  People want this, and it isn't some arbitrary, illogical consumer demand.  It's perfectly reasonable for users to want a currency where the cost for the unit is small and the resulting prices of goods and services are whole numbers.

Consumer demand aside, it seems intuitive that a fledgling currency (such as Dash) should have a unit (i.e. `DASH`) whose value is much lower than a widely-used currency's unit (e.g. USD).  People generally have no concept of money supply, so we should accommodate that and design a unit that makes intuitive sense.

Similar to how Bitcoin will not be able to continue functioning as a store of value if it does not fix its medium of exchange problems (high transaction fees), **Dash will find it hard to continue functioning as a medium of exchange, and hence store of value, if it does not fix its unit of account problems**.  People *do* consider the unit of account aspects of money, even if subconsciously, in their evaluations of which coin they want to buy and transact with.  It's not necessarily that they want to try to get rich off a penny currency.  Chances are it just makes more intuitive sense to buy the lower cost coin.  It's user friendly.  Less "expensive" coins seem to them less likely to be "in a bubble".  They look at coins over $1,000 and instinctively assume they've "missed the boat".  Sure, that may be a misconception, but that's the psychological reality, so that's what we should deal with.  Why fight human nature?

To summarize the problem, Dash faces serious challenges because of its unit of account, the `DASH`.  There are psychological, technical, and practical issues involved.

##### Psychological

* People think dash is *"expensive"*
* People feel they *own relatively little dash*, even after they've paid a lot for it

##### Practical

* It's difficult to grasp conceptually how much you are paying when you see a dash price.
* It can be difficult to see where the decimal is, and it's inconsistent from person to person:
  * some people write `.00012345`, some people write `0.00012345`
* It's harder to speak in fractions and small decimals:
  * "point zero, zero, zero, one, two, three, four, five dash" - awkward
  * "one twenty three point forty five dash" - much better

##### Technical

* Existing software is tailored to *100 subunits per unit*

### The Solution

As seen from the links above, many solutions have been proposed.  One somewhat popular solution for Bitcoin has been the somewhat organic introduction of the term "bits", where `1 BTC` is split into `1,000,000 bits`.  This movement has seen considerable opposition, which in turn has split the community.  Some people want to promote the scientific terms derived from `BTC` (`mBTC` and `uBTC`). Still others have proposed new names for the scientific denominations.  **None of these solutions are ideal, and I believe none of them will work**.  I will explain my reasoning below.

First, to summarize Dash's potential solutions (which largely parallel Bitcoin's, none of which will likely work), we can:

* support **scientific units** based on `DASH`.
  * i.e. `mDASH` ("milidash"), `uDASH` ("microdash")
* support the **base unit**.
  * i.e. `DUFF` ("duff" - the actual technological base unit in Dash, which the code already uses)
* create **new unit(s)**.
  * e.g. `DOT` ("dot", possibly equal in value to a `uDASH`)
* promote/defer to **fiat/national units**.
  * e.g. `USD`, `EUR`, `JPY` (hide Dash's native units in favor of displaying existing fiat units)

What do all of these solutions have in common? They all allow for the continued use of `DASH` and `DUFF`.  Even if Dash Core Group, Inc (DCG) decides to move forward with one of the above options, say, using the `DOT`, there will be large contingents of people who oppose that and will continue to use `DASH` and `DUFF`, because those options likely won't get deprecated.  The existing `DASH` will remain the transaction unit on exchanges, leaving most of the benefits of this proposal behind.

##### Sample Objections to Existing Solutions

* Scientific names (`mDASH` and `uDASH`) are too technical for mass mass adoption and lead to disunity of pricing (5 units now!).
* `DUFF` is too unprofessional for the main unit, sounding too much like duff beer from the Simpsons.
* `DOT` would have to overcome massive social inertia and would also result in disunity of pricing (3 units now!).
* Relying solely on fiat seems to be admitting two things:
  * 1\. Dash's units are confusing and need to be hidden away.
  * 2\. We don't intend to be our own independent currency.
  * The solution isn't to hide `DASH`, it's to fix it!

Any change that isn't made at the protocol level will result in **long-term** confusion about units.  **There will be no clear consensus** regarding which unit system is used around the globe.  This is happening with Bitcoin, some users are trying to push for `bits`, others hate that and want to use scientific units, others hate that and want to create different names for every denomination, which both former groups hate.  Long-term confusion and division.

The only solution I see is to **re-denominate (re-define) the `DASH`**.  In my experience, most people like, even love, the term "`DASH`".  They have implicitly demonstrated that by the fact that they acquired some.  I think few would say that they actually *like* the very small fractions they encounter with the typical small-value transaction.  Hence, I think **sticking with the term `DASH` is the least controversial option** for the unit to promote for mass adoption.

So, if we agree that we want to continue using the term "`DASH`", but refine it so that it's more comfortable to use, the main question would be what order of magnitude to choose for the new definition.  For example, we could redefine the `DASH` to equal `100,000 DUFF`, so that `1 DASH` is now 1,000 times smaller, resulting in a new `DASH/USD` price of about `$1.20` (instead of `$1,200`).  Or, we could move it one more order of magnitude so that the price would be `$0.12`.  But this is not very forward thinking.  A few years down the road we might find ourselves in the same position we are in now.

##### Proposed Solution

I propose the following new denomination: **`1 DASH` = `100 DUFF`**.

This gives us a **denomination that facilitates using whole numbers** even when dealing with small value transfers.  As an added bonus it puts us **on par with all major national currencies, where the popular unit is comprised of 100 subunits**.  That's very user-friendly, and user-friendly is Dash's jam.

Note that this would *not* expand the money supply, this is merely a shift in *nomenclature* (naming convention).  It is redefining the `DASH`, but `DASH` has nothing to do with the money supply.  The true money supply is how many `DUFF`s exist, and that number isn't changing.

To summarize:

* Before/Now: `1 DASH` = `100,000,000 DUFF` (by definition)
* After/Future: `1 DASH` = `100 DUFF` (new definition)
* Implication: `1 DASH` --> `1,000,000 DASH`
  * What we now call `1 DASH`, would henceforth be `1,000,000 DASH`

##### Key Benefits

* Working with whole numbers is better than decimal units:
  * Instead of seeing `0.00123456 DASH` you see `1,234.56 DASH`.
* There's no need for grandma to learn scientific notation or computer terminology to buy a stick of butter.
* There's no need to come up with new, controversial naming conventions, at all.
* We should only have to do this re-denomination (new definition) once.
* We end up with 100 subunits per main unit, just like most traditional currencies.
  * Hence, it will be more compatible with existing financial software.
* People will be more cognizant of purchasing power increases over time:
  * Even though merchants may be *pricing* their goods in `USD`, Dash consumers can recall their costs in `DASH`.
  * "Last month this coffee cost me `200 DASH`, now this same coffee costs only `130 DASH`."

##### Implementation Considerations

If you could wave a magic wand that immediately fixed the `DASH` unit as explained above, would you wave that wand?  If so, the question isn't "should we make that change", but rather:

* What is involved in making this change?
* How much will it cost?
* Can we afford it?
* When should we make the change?

Some might object saying, this is not technically possible.  To which I would say, that is incorrect.  Software is always changeable.  I don't expect this to be nearly as much of a technical challenge as it will be a social challenge.  How can we get people to agree to this change, conceptually?  How, after we agree, can we roll it out to all the [stakeholders](https://dashpay.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/124125739/Stakeholder+status) (wallets, exchanges, etc)?

Fortunately, we have a governance system designed exactly for this kind of thing.  We can put it up to a vote to see whether we want to pursue this.  The first question might be whether we should fund a feasibility study.  Subsequent proposals can then be submitted to pay for implementation costs.

A lot of software will need to be updated, but what is the alternative?  It's better now than later.  **The opportunity *costs* are likely much, much higher than the implementation costs**.

Foreseeable work includes:

* Core software updates (DCG, mobile wallets, etc.)
* Exchange software updates (Poloniex, Bittrex, etc)
* Peripheral tooling updates (moocowmoo tools, masternode tools, paper wallet tools, etc.)
* Documentation updates
* Marketing efforts (from DCG marketing arm as well as from community sources)

##### Timing

When should we implement the fix?  It seems to make sense to roll out this change with Evolution, concurrent with the expected Dash re-brand.

Dash has a unique opportunity to shine here.  Here we have a problem (that almost everyone in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other communities admits is a problem) that Dash can solve.  That's yet another feather in our cap, along with InstantSend, PrivateSend, and our governance/treasury system (which, as a side note, could use a catchyName like the other two major features Dash boasts).  Imagine the bragging rights alone that Dash would have, not that we would necessarily use said bragging rights, this is Dash after all.  We solved yet another problem Bitcoin couldn't.

We have the money, we have the technical team to pull it off, we have a powerful marketing firm that can ensure that this is delivered as a huge achievement, and we have a community and governance mechanism to pull it all together.  I can't think of better timing than concurrent with Evolution and the re-brand.  If we wait til after that, it's likely a non-starter.

Bitcoin just turned 9 years old on January 3, 2018.  Satoshi's first mined block was the dawn of an entirely new industry, that of cryptographically-secured, open-source, free-market money.  Ever since the first fork into a new competing currency, Bitcoin's position in terms of market share has dwindled.  Bitcoin has not achieved "digital cash" status.  It seems to have given up on that goal, settling for a simple **store of value**.

Dash has, as its name suggests, set its sights squarely on being "digital cash".  In addition to store of value, it has committed to being a viable **medium of exchange**, even for small value transfers.  But will it achieve that?  *Can* it achieve that without fixing the **unit of account**?  I'm gradually starting to see that **this is an all or nothing proposition**.  If you want to compete with the big boys in currency, you must design your coin to be a store of value, a medium of exchange, *and* a unit of account.  *All three* must be *optimized*, or you *will be* out-competed.  Welcome to the free market.

Dash is now approaching its 4th year in existence.  **We have currently claimed just over 1% of the market share**.  Recent entrants who have more attractive units of account have come out of obscurity and blown by Dash in a matter of weeks.  Why?  Could it have anything to do with how they've designed their units?

It's time to take action.  It's time to proactively address this issue head on.  Dash has a good chance of dominating this new industry of free market money, but only if we continue to innovate.  **Our position is *not* inevitable**.  We may have more money to work with than any other coin, but we must use it properly.  Let's not lose sight of the goal to be a currency.  Let's not ignore one of the three pillars of currency, unit of account.  If we fix `DASH` (the unit), we will have a much higher chance of fixing Dash (the currency, community, and ecosystem) - fixing it into the #1 position in the industry, that is.
